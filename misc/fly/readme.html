        <h1>Python Coding Contest (Contest #1)</h1>
    </div>
    <h2>Contest Idea</h2>
    <p>I've decided to try hosting a weekly Python programming contest. 
    </p>
    <p>For now, I'll be judging solutions first by correctness and then by
    speed. I'd prefer to judge on some other criterion, such as elegance,
    but it is hard to do so objectively. But I will provide my unofficial,
    non-objective judgement of the best design too.</p>
    
    <p>At the end of the contest, I'll run benchmarks and post the results,
    along with all the submitted solutions, on my website. I'll also write
    a summary for the Python list</p>
    <p>I'm going to start small and any feedback would be very welcome
    (<a href="mailto:brian@sweetapp.com">Brian Quinlan &lt;brian@sweetapp.com&gt;</a>)!
    Now onto the first problem...
    <h2>Problem Description</h2>
    <p>
    This problem is an adaptation of the real-life problem: how to
    fly from A to B with the minimum possible cost. Since I am 
    incredibly cheap, I am willing to take several flights to get
    to my final destination. I'm more far more concerned with
    money than with prompt arrival, so the complete trip can take an
    arbitrary amount of time. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Your task is to write a scheduling module that generates the cheapest
    possible route from A to B.
    </p>
    <p>The solution requires a bit of thinking but not much code (my solution
    is 40 lines of code, including comments).</p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <pre>        
    >>> from fly import fly
    >>> schedule = [
    ... # (from, to) : cost
    ... {('A', 'B') : 100.00, ('A', 'C') : 10.00, ('C', 'B') : 20}, # Day 1
    ... {('A', 'B') : 100.00, ('A', 'C') : 10.00, ('C', 'B') : 20}] # Day 2
    >>> # Calculate the optimal route to fly from A to B. The route should be:
    >>> # Day 1: A => C (cost 20) 
    >>> # Day 2: C => B (cost 20)
    >>> fly('A', 'B', schedule)
    ['C', 'B']

    >>> schedule = [
    ...   # From    # To       # Cost
    ... {('Athens', 'Berlin') : 55.25,   # Day 1 flights
    ...  ('Berlin', 'Athens') : 73.00,   
    ...  ('Dresden', 'Athens') : 85.50,
    ...  ('Dresden', 'Berlin') : 12.50},
    ... {('Berlin', 'Athens') : 23.55,   # Day 2 flights
    ...  ('Berlin', 'Cairo') : 125.15,  
    ...  ('Berlin', 'Dresden') : 18.25,
    ...  ('Dresden', 'Athens') : 85.50,
    ...  ('Dresden', 'Berlin') : 13.50},
    ... {('Athens', 'Cairo') : 65.55,    # Day 3 flights
    ...  ('Berlin', 'Athens') : 23.55,
    ...  ('Berlin', 'Cairo') : 125.15,
    ...  ('Dresden', 'Athens') : 85.50},
    ... {('Athens', 'Cairo') : 7.25,     # Day 4 flights
    ...  ('Berlin', 'Athens') : 23.55,
    ...  ('Dresden', 'Athens') : 85.50}]

    >>> # Calculate the optimal route to fly from Dresden to Cairo.
    >>> # The route should be:
    >>> # Day 1: Dresden => Berlin (cost 12.50) 
    >>> # Day 2: Berlin => Athens (cost 23.55)
    >>> # Day 3: Athens (stay the day: fixed cost of 20)
    >>> # Day 4: Athens => Cairo (cost  7.25)
    >>> # If you think that this route is absurd, let me assure
    >>> # you that I am actually flying it (including the night in
    >>> # Athens) in October
    >>> fly('Dresden', 'Cairo', schedule)
    ['Berlin', 'Athens', 'Athens', 'Cairo']
    >>> # There is now way to get from Cairo to Dresden
    >>> fly('Cairo', 'Dresden', schedule)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError
    </pre>
    <h2>Assumptions</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>All flights are scheduled at noon and take less than a day to complete
        i.e. at most one flight per day can be taken.</li>
        
        <li>It is possible to take not a flight on a day but it costs 20 &#8364; (for a 
        rock-bottom hostel - I can sleep in the airplane but not in the airport)</i>
        
        <li>It is not always possible to reach the desired destination. In that case
        you should raise ValueError</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Test Framework/Module Stub</h2>
    <p>You can download a stub version of the fly module along with a simple
    test suite <a href="problem.zip">here</a>.
    <h2>Submitting your Solution</h2>
    <p>The solution deadline is July 24, 2005. 
    When you are done your implementation, please send it to me at
    <a href="mailto:brian@sweetapp.com">Brian Quinlan &lt;brian@sweetapp.com&gt;</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Testing</h2>
    <p>
    I'm going to test all of the submissions using the test suite
    that you can find as part of test framework. I will pick a random
    seed so everyone's tests
    are identical (I'm a very fair person).</p>
    <p>The exact test environment will be:
    <ul>
        <li>IBM Thinkpad T41 (768MB RAM, 1.6GHz Centrino)
        <li>Python 2.4.1 (with -OO switch; no extra modules)</li>
        <li>Ubuntu 5.04 Live CD</li>
    </ul>
